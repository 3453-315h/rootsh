## rootsh

~~rootsh is a local privilege escalation targeting OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 build
14F27. It exploits [CVE-2016-1758] and [CVE-2016-1828], two vulnerabilities in
XNU that were patched in OS X El Capitan [10.11.4] and [10.11.5]. rootsh will
not work on platforms with SMAP enabled.~~

~~### CVE-2016-1758~~

~~CVE-2016-1758 is an information leak caused by copying out uninitialized bytes
of kernel stack to user space. By comparing leaked kernel pointers with fixed
reference addresses it is possible to recover the kernel slide.~~

~~### CVE-2016-1828~~

~~CVE-2016-1828 is a use-after-free during object deserialization. By passing a
crafted binary-serialized dictionary into the kernel, it is possible to trigger
a virtual method invocation on an object with a controlled vtable pointer.~~

rootsh is a local privilege escalation targeting OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 build
15G31. It exploits [CVE-2016-4656] and [CVE-2016-4657] \(Pegasus exploiuts),
two vulnerabilities in XNU that were patched in OS X El Capitan [10.11.6].
rootsh will not work on platforms with SMAP enabled.

### CVE-2016-4656

CVE-2016-4656 is an information leak caused by copying big sized OSNumber with
kernel stack data to user space. Kernel pointers from stack can be masked to
recover the kernel slide.

### CVE-2016-4657

CVE-2016-4657 is a use-after-free during object deserialization. By passing a
crafted binary-serialized dictionary into the kernel, it is possible to trigger
a virtual method invocation on an object with a controlled vtable pointer.
It's a different vulnerabilty, then CVE-2016-1828.
